### Project Overview

This project is a database-driven web application built with Flask that showcases fashion product data from an open dataset. The application allows users to browse products, filter them by various attributes, and view detailed information about products and brands, along with relevant analytics.

### Data Source

The application uses fashion product data from a comprehensive CSV dataset containing over 12,000 fashion items. The dataset includes product names, brands, pricing, gender classification, and other attributes. For this application, I've used a subset of 7,000 records to comply with the assignment requirements.

### Design Decisions

1. **Database Schema**
   - Created two linked tables: `Products` and `Brands` with a one-to-many relationship
   - Products table contains all product details including foreign key reference to brands
   - This design enables efficient querying and robust data relationships

2. **Application Structure**
   - Used Flask Blueprints for modular code organization (main, products, brands)
   - Applied the application factory pattern for better testability and configuration
   - Implemented proper error handling for 404, 500, and other errors

3. **Data Processing**
   - Used Pandas for efficient CSV data import
   - Implemented batch processing to handle large datasets effectively
   - Created relationships between products and brands during import

4. **User Interface**
   - Clean, responsive design that works across devices
   - Filtering capabilities for gender, brand, color, and price range
   - Pagination to handle large result sets
   - Detailed product and brand views with related information

5. **Analytics**
   - Added analytics on both product and brand pages
   - Price comparisons within brands
   - Product distribution by gender and color

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Data Import Performance**
   - Challenge: Importing thousands of records efficiently
   - Solution: Implemented batch processing and optimized database commit patterns

2. **Relational Data Modeling**
   - Challenge: Creating meaningful relationships between products and brands
   - Solution: Used SQLAlchemy relationships and proper database design

3. **Flask Deployment to Render**
   - Challenge: Configuring the application for cloud deployment
   - Solution: Used environment variables and Gunicorn for production deployment

### Testing Strategy

- Created comprehensive unit tests for models and routes
- Used pytest fixtures for test data setup
- Implemented test coverage for critical application components

### Git Workflow

- Used branching strategy with main and development branches
- Implemented feature branches for major components
- Regular commits with descriptive messages

### Deployment Process

The application is deployed on Render using a PostgreSQL database. The deployment process involved:

1. Setting up environment variables for production
2. Configuring database migrations
3. Implementing Gunicorn as the WSGI server

### Future Improvements

1. User authentication and personalization features
2. Advanced search capabilities
3. Image integration for product visuals
4. Performance optimization for larger datasets

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of Flask, SQLAlchemy, and related technologies to build a database-driven web application with proper error handling, testing, and deployment practices. The modular design allows for future extension and maintenance.
